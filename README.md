# Ciphers

This is a super fun code for a superfun cipher encoder and decoder.
Use it to send secret codes to your friends!
My personal favourite is the Vigen√®re Cipher because the recipient needs the encoded text and the secret codeword!
No copyright. Use it however you want.
URGENT: If you downloaded version 1.0 or 1.1 of my app, delete the installer and the app (instruction guide in my 2.0 release (https://github.com/II-Dragon14/ciphers/releases/tag/v2.0)
Just want to give a shoutout to @bloxer126g with his .DUM File Translator (https://github.com/Bloxer126g/.DUM-file-translator).
He gave me the whole idea!
